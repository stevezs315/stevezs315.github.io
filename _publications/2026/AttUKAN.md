  .We propose a new retinal vessel segmentation model named AttUKAN to selectively filter skip connection features and a Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss (LPCL) to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing between foreground vessel-pixel sample pairs
and background sample pairs.
