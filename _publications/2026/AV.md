  We design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions and a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained representations for accurate 
  retinal A/V classification.
