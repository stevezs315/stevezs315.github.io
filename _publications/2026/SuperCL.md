  We propose SuperCL, a superpixel-guided contrastive learning framework for medical image segmentation pre-training, which exploits the structural prior and pixel correlation of images by introducing two novel contrastive pairs generation strategies: Intra-image Local Contrastive Pairs (ILCP) Generation and Inter-image
  Global Contrastive Pairs (IGCP) Generation.
