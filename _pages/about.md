Hi, my name is Shuang Zeng, welcome to my homepage. I received my bachelor's degree in Engineering from Peking Unversity, Beijing, China in 2021. Currently, I am a Biomedical Engineering joint Ph.D. student of Peking University - Georgia Institute of Technology - Emory University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qiushi Ren](https://future.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/jy/swyxgcx1/9b0b9d9a9635465898577c28b0b03c01.htm) from College of Future Technology, PKU and [Prof. May Dongmei Wang](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/May-Dongmei-Wang) from Wallace H. Coulter Department
of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. My research interest mainly focuses on self-supervised contrastive learning, Large Language Models, explainable AI and medical image processing. Welcome to reach out to me for communication and cooperation!
